Disclaimer: I'd recommend using android biometric tutorial for a better understanding of biometric. Use the medium article as a way to enchance your knowledge after understanding the fundamentals. 

This project is built on fake mock and doesn't use real data (apart from biometric). Sign in is fake and doesn't persist. This work was done as part of innovation.

Libraries used:
 - Compose (UI)
 - Hilt (Dependency Injection)
 - Timber (Logging)
 - Lottie (Animation)
